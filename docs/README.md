# Templating from Generators

## Basics

Currently rendering templates operates in two phases:

- Generate all template parameters from the configured generators
- Render all the templates for each set of template parameters

Please read the [security information](#security) below before using this.

## Generation

The simplest generator is the `List` generator.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
          - env: production
            team: ops-team
          - env: staging
            team: ops-team
```

The elements in there are a set JSON of objects[^yaml], there are three in this example, and each of them has two keys, `env` and `team`.

Other generators provide different sets of keys and values.

The [generators](#generators) documentation below provides more information on what the other generators output.

## Rendering templates

Templates are Kubernetes resources in YAML format.

Each template is rendered for each element generated by the generators.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
          - env: production
            team: ops-team
          - env: staging
            team: ops-team
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .Element.env }}-demo"
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: go-demo
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .Element.env }}"
            com.example/team: "{{ .Element.team }}"
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/{{ .Element.env }}"
          prune: true
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: go-demo-repo
```

The generated elements are provided to the template in the `Element` scope, so
`.Element.dev` refers to the `dev` field from the List element.

The output from all generators is exposed in the `Element` scope, not just List
generators.

## Repeating templates

The output from a generator is an array of JSON objects[^yaml], the keys of which can contain repeating elements, either further JSON objects, or scalar values.

It can be desirable to repeat a template for a repeated element in a generated
value.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: repeated-gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
            teams:
              - name: "team1"
              - name: "team2"
              - name: "team3"
          - env: staging
            team: staging-team
            teams:
              - name: "team4"
              - name: "team5"
              - name: "team6"
  templates:
    - repeat: "{ .teams }"
      content:
        kind: ConfigMap
        apiVersion: v1
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .Repeat.name }}-demo"
        data:
          name: "{{ .Repeat.name }}-demo"
          team: "{{ .Element.team }}"
```

The template `repeat` field is a [JSONPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) expression that is applied to each element during the template rendering.

Templates that use `repeat` will have two separate scopes for the template params, `.Element` which is the top-level element generated by the generator, and the additional `.Repeat` scope, which is the repeating element.

In this case, six different `ConfigMaps` are generated, three for the "dev-team" and three for the "staging-team".

## Generators

We currently provide these generators:
 - [list](#list-generator)
 - [pullRequests](#pullrequests-generator)
 - [gitRepository](#gitrepository-generator)
 - [matrix](#matrix-generator)
 - [apiClient](#apiclient-generator)

### List generator

This is the simplest generator, which is a hard-coded array of JSON objects, described as YAML mappings.

### GitRepository generator

The `GitRepository` generator operates on [Flux GitRepositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/).

When a `GitRepository` is updated, this will trigger a regeneration of templates.

The generator operates in two different ways, you can parse files (YAML or JSON) into Elements, or you can scan directories for subdirectories.

#### Generation from files

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: repository-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - gitRepository:
        repositoryRef: go-demo-repo
        files:
          - path: examples/generation/dev.yaml
          - path: examples/generation/production.yaml
          - path: examples/generation/staging.yaml
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .Element.env }}-demo"
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: go-demo
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .Element.env }}"
            com.example/team: "{{ .Element.team }}"
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/{{ .Element.env }}"
          prune: true
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: go-demo-repo
```

In this example, a [Flux `GitRepository`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/) called `go-demo-repo` in the same namespace as the `GitOpsSet` will be tracked, and `Kustomization` resources will be generated from the three files listed.

These files can be JSON or YAML.

In this example we expect to find the following structure in the files:

```yaml
env: dev
team: developers
```

Changes pushed to the `GitRepository` will result in rereconciliation of the templates into the cluster.

For security reasons, you need to explicitly list out the files that the generator should parse.

#### Generation from directories

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: gitopsset
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: gitopsset-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: gitopssets-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: gitopssets-controller
  name: repository-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - gitRepository:
        repositoryRef: go-demo-repo
        directories:
          - path: examples/kustomize/environments/*
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .Element.Base }}-demo"
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: go-demo
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .Element.Base }}"
            com.example/team: "{{ .Element.Base }}"
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "{{ .Element.Directory }}"
          prune: true
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: go-demo-repo
```
In this example, a [Flux `GitRepository`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/) called `go-demo-repo` in the same namespace as the `GitOpsSet` will be tracked, and `Kustomization` resources are generated from paths within the `examples/kustomize/environments/*` directory within the repository.

Each generated element has two keys, `.Element.Directory` which will be a repo-relative path and `.Element.Base` which contains the last element of the path, for example, for a directory `./examples/kustomize/environments/production` this will be `production`.

It is also possible to exclude paths from the generated list, for example, if you do not want to generate for a directory you can exclude it with:
```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: repository-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - gitRepository:
        repositoryRef: go-demo-repo
        directories:
          - path: examples/kustomize/environments/*
          - path: examples/kustomize/environments/production
            exclude: true
  templates:
    - content:
```
In this case, all directories that are subdirectories of `examples/kustomize/environments` will be generated, **but** not `examples/kustomize/environments/production`.

**Note**: The directory tree detection is restricted to the same directory as the path, no recursion is done.

In fact the path is treated as a [Glob](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Glob).

### PullRequests generator

This will require to make authenticated requests to your Git hosting provider e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc.

It does only require read-only access, but all API tokens should be guarded as carefully as possible, what is a "read-only" token today, might become a token with higher-privilege in the future.

_There have been many security compromises using API access tokens, do not let this happen to you!_

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: pull-requests-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - pullRequests:
        interval: 5m
        driver: github
        repo: bigkevmcd/go-demo
        secretRef:
          name: github-secret
  templates:
    - content:
        apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        kind: GitRepository
        metadata:
          name: "pr-{{ .Element.Number }}-gitrepository"
          namespace: default
        spec:
          interval: 5m0s
          url: "{{ .Element.CloneURL }}"
          ref:
            branch: "{{ .Element.Branch }}"
    - content:
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        kind: Kustomization
        metadata:
          name: "pr-{{ .Element.Number }}-demo"
          namespace: default
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/dev"
          prune: true
          targetNamespace: "{{ .Element.Branch }}-ns"
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: "pr-{{ .Element.Number }}-gitrepository"
```

This example will poll "github.com/bigkevmcd/go-demo" for open pull requests and trigger the deployment of these by creating a Flux `GitRepository` and a `Kustomization` to deploy.

As the generator only queries open pull requests, when a PR is closed, the generated resources will be removed.

For non-public installations, you can configure the `serverURL` field and point it to your own installation.

The `driver` field can be `github` or `gitlab` or `bitbucketserver`, other options can be supported from [go-scm](https://github.com/jenkins-x/go-scm/blob/main/scm/factory/factory.go).

The `forks` flag field can be used to indicate whether to include forks in the target pull requests or not. If set to `true` any pull request from a fork repository will be included, otherwise if `false` or not indicated the pull requests from fork repositories are discarded.

Additionally labels can be provided for querying pull requests with matching labels e.g.

```yaml
- pullRequests:
    interval: 5m
    driver: github
    repo: bigkevmcd/go-demo
    secretRef:
      name: github-secret
    forks: false
    labels:
      - deploy
```

The fields emitted by the pull-request are as follows:

- `Number` this is generated as a string representation
- `Branch` this is the source branch
- `HeadSHA` this is the SHA of the commit in the merge branch
- `CloneURL` this is the HTTPS clone URL for this repository
- `CloneSSHURL` this is the SSH clone URL for this repository
- `Fork` this indicates whether the pull request is from a fork (true) or not (false)

Create a read-only token that can list Pull Requests, and store it in a secret:

```shell
$ kubectl create secret generic github-secret \
  --from-literal password=<insert access token here>
```

### Matrix generator

The matrix generator doesn't generate resources by itself. It combines the results of
generation from other generators e.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: matrix-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - matrix:
        generators:
          - gitRepository:
              repositoryRef: go-demo-repo
              files:
                - path: examples/generation/dev.yaml
                - path: examples/generation/production.yaml
                - path: examples/generation/staging.yaml
          - list:
              elements:
                - cluster: dev-cluster
                  version: 1.0.0
```

Given the files mentioned all have the following structure:

```yaml
env: dev
team: developers
```

This will result in three sets of generated parameters, which are a combination of the maps in the files in the gitRepository, and the elements in the list generator, this can result in a combinatorial explosion of resources being created in your cluster.

```yaml
- env: dev
  team: developers
  cluster: dev-cluster
  version: 1.0.0
- env: staging
  team: staging-team
  cluster: dev-cluster
  version: 1.0.0
- env: production
  team: production-team
  cluster: dev-cluster
  version: 1.0.0
```

These can be referenced in the templates, note that all keys in the merged generators from the Matrix are contained in the `Element` scope.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: matrix-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - matrix:
        generators:
          - gitRepository:
              repositoryRef: go-demo-repo
              files:
                - path: examples/generation/dev.yaml
                - path: examples/generation/production.yaml
                - path: examples/generation/staging.yaml
          - list:
              elements:
                - cluster: dev-cluster
                  version: 1.0.0
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .Element.env }}-demo"
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: go-demo
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .Element.env }}"
            com.example/team: "{{ .Element.team }}"
            com.example/cluster: "{{ .Element.cluster }}"
            com.example/version: "{{ .Element.version }}"
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/{{ .Element.env }}"
          prune: true
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: go-demo-repo
```

### apiClient generator

This generator is configured to poll an HTTP endpoint and parse the result as the generated values.

This will poll an endpoint on the interval, instead of using the simpler to use PullRequest generator, you can access GitHub's API with the APIClient generator.

The PullRequest generator is simpler to use, and works across multiple different git-providers.

The GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-pull-requests) for the API endpoint shows:

```shell
curl \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>"\
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls
```
This can be translated into...
```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: gitopsset
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: gitopsset-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: gitopssets-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: gitopssets-controller
  name: api-client-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - apiClient:
        interval: 5m
        endpoint: https://api.github.com/repos/bigkevmcd/go-demo/pulls
        headersRef:
          name: github-secret
          kind: Secret
  templates:
    - content:
        apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        kind: GitRepository
        metadata:
          name: "pr-{{ .Element.id | toJson}}-gitrepository"
          namespace: default
        spec:
          interval: 5m0s
          url: "{{ .Element.head.repo.clone_url }}"
          ref:
            branch: "{{ .Element.head.ref }}"
    - content:
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        kind: Kustomization
        metadata:
          name: "pr-{{ .Element.id | toJson }}-demo"
          namespace: default
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/dev"
          prune: true
          targetNamespace: "{{ .Element.head.ref }}-ns"
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: "pr-{{ .Element.id | toJson }}-gitrepository"
```
As with the [Pull Request generator](#pullrequests-generator), this also requires a secret token to be able to access the API

We need to pass this as an HTTP header.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: github-secret
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
stringData:
  Accept: application/vnd.github+json
  Authorization: Bearer ghp_<redacted>
  X-GitHub-Api-Version: "2022-11-28"
```
The keys in the secret match the command-line example using curl.

Unlike the Pull Request generator, you need to figure out the paths to the
elements yourself.

#### APIClient JSONPath

Not all APIs return an array of JSON objects, sometimes it's nested within a result type structure e.g.

```json
{
  "things": [
    {
      "env": "dev",
      "team": "dev-team"
    },
    {
      "env": "production",
      "team": "opts-team"
    },
    {
      "env": "staging",
      "team": "opts-team"
    }
  ]
}
```
You can use JSONPath to extract the fields from this data...
```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: gitopsset
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: gitopsset-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: gitopssets-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: gitopssets-controller
  name: api-client-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - apiClient:
        interval: 5m
        endpoint: https://api.example.com/demo
        jsonPath: "{ $.things }"
```
This will generate three maps for templates, with just the _env_ and _team_ keys.

#### APIClient POST body

Another piece of functionality in the APIClient generator is the ability to POST
JSON to the API.
```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: gitopsset
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: gitopsset-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: gitopssets-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: gitopssets-controller
  name: api-client-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - apiClient:
        interval: 5m
        endpoint: https://api.example.com/demo
        body:
          name: "testing"
          value: "testing2"
```
This will send a request body as JSON (Content-Type "application/json") to the
server and interpret the result.

The JSON body sent will look like this:
```json
{"name":"testing","value":"testing2"}
```

## Templating functions

Currently, the [Sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) functions are available in the templating, with some functions removed[^sprig] for security reasons.

In addition, we also provide two additional functions:

 * sanitize - sanitises strings to be compatible with [Kubernetes DNS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names) name requirements
 * getordefault - gets a key from the `.Element` or defaults to another value.

The examples below assume an element that looks like this:
```json
{
  "team": "engineering dev"
}
```

### sanitize template function

And a template that looks like this:
```yaml
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ sanitize .Element.team }}-demo
```

This would output:
```yaml
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: engineeringdev-demo
```

### getordefault

For template that looks like this:
```yaml
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ getordefault .Element "name" "defaulted" }}-demo
```

This would output:
```yaml
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: defaulted-demo
```

If the _key_ to get does exist in the `.Element` it will be inserted, the "default" is only inserted if it doesn't exist.

## Security

**WARNING** generating resources and applying them directly into your cluster can be dangerous to the health of your cluster.

This is especially true for the `GitRepository` generator, where it may not be obvious to the author of the files, or the author of the template the consequences of the template rendering.

The default `ServiceAccount` that is used by the gitopssets-controller is extremely limited, and can not create resources, you will need to explicitly grant permissions to create any of the resources you declare in the template, missing permissions will appear in the controller logs.

It is not recommended that you create a role with blanket permissions, under the right circumstances, someone could accidentally _or_ maliciously overwrite the cluster control-plane, which could be very dangerous.

## Limiting via service-accounts

You can configure the service-account that is used to create resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: matrix-sample
spec:
  # the controller will impersonate this service account
  serviceAccountName: test-sa
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
          - env: production
            team: ops-team
          - env: staging
            team: ops-team
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
